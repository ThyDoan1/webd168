          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student who is passionate about the
            technology world. I've been taking classes at San Diego Mesa College
            in order to transfer to an university. Recently, I just got accepted
            into San Diego State University, which I'm very happy, and I want to
            share the news with you. It's my dream to become a Software Engineer
            in the future, so getting a Bachelor degree would help me achieve my
            goal.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>
            Over the last few years, I've gained many helpful skills, both
            coding skills and soft skills, by taking in-person classes, online
            courses, and self-taught during my free time. I enjoy learning new
            coding skills, basic coding fundamental concepts, and love to see
            how my skills is growing. The learning process might be overwhelming
            sometimes, but I love the feeling whenever I overcome a difficult
            challenge.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            During my free time, I love painting, reading books, playing video
            games, cooking, and playing with my cats. I have 2 cats who are
            litter mates, and they just turned 2 years old last month. One of
            them is a Tabby, named Muffin, and the other one is a Tuxedo, named
            Blu. They are as active as they are kittens, and I love both of them
            a lot. Here are pictures of them when I first adopted them.
