      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student who is passionate about the technology
        world. I've been taking classes at San Diego Mesa College in order to
        transfer to an university. Recently, I just got accepted into San Diego
        State University, which I'm very happy, and I want to share the news
        with you. It's my dream to become a Software Engineer in the future, so
        getting a Bachelor degree would help me achieve my goal.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last few years, I've gained many helpful skills, both coding
        skills and soft skills, by taking in-person classes, online courses, and
        self-taught during my free time. I enjoy learning new coding skills,
        basic coding fundamental concepts, and love to see how my skills is
        growing. The learning process might be overwhelming sometimes, but I
        love the feeling whenever I overcome a difficult challenge.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        During my free time, I love painting, reading books, playing video
        games, cooking, and playing with my cats. I have 2 cats who are litter
        mates, and they just turned 2 years old last month. One of them is a
        Tabby, named Muffin, and the other one is a Tuxedo, named Blu. They are
        as active as they are kittens, and I love both of them a lot. Here are
        pictures of them when I first adopted them.
